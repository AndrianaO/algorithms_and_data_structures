If there is more than one pair of duplicates, the code should return the one with the closest distance to the root. To be honest, this part of the question confuses me because I do not know the definition of the distance to the root of the duplicate pair. I assume the pair distance is defined by the furthest node in the duplicate pair, not by the closest one. \n"

The queue is investigated in the while loop: the node is deleted from the left side of the queue. The value of this node is checked whether it is in the set and if yes it is returned. Otherwise it is saved to the set. If the child left node exists it is appended to the queue. The same for the right one.

    "This assignment was an unusual experience. I was assigned the third question about the missing number in the range. To be honest, I spent a lot of time trying to introduce somehow the Binary Tree in my solution and only after a while I realised that this has nothing to do with the first two questions. The simplest approach I thought of ended actually in the alternative solution section because its time complexity was worse than the second approach I implemented. I also used timeit as it was shown at lectures to check the different approach performances (but I did not include it in the submission). It was also interesting to review my partner's code and to think about the first question. I can confirm that my partner did a great job with the assignment and I could not wish for a better-documented piece of code. I completely agree with my partner's approach and I believe I would do pretty much the same. Also, it was fun to create what I thought was a tricky example and find out that my partner's code was working correctly! Overall, I had a great time with those assignments"
